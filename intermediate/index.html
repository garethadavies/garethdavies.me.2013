			<div class="column-left pull-left">

				<p>Carer+ is the latest project for the Just Checking development team. An on-brand, friendly and usable experience for the product's target audience was set as the overall goal. Careful user experience planning and testing have allowed us to produce a single-page application that utilises the Just Checking API to provide JSON data consumed by a front-end built using Backbone and MarionetteJS alongside the excellent Foundation front-end framework developed by Zurb. My role in this project is primary user experience designer and front-end developer.</p>

				<p>The Just Checking Support Dashboard is an internal application that allows staff members to access information quickly and efficiently when dealing with customer support issues. The app was developed using user stories that were created by the staff members during planning sessions run by the development team. This active system is undergoing constant improvement due to regular, deliberate user feedback. My role in this project was as primary user experience designer and front-end developer.</p>

			<div class="column-left pull-left">

				<p>The Birmingham City University web platform project took place over 3 years and included a initial 6 month consultation and planning period, then 18 months of actual development and testing, all to bring together hundreds of satellite websites under one, consistently branded web platform and CMS. Version 2.0 of the website was a visual refresh of the website developed over the previous 2 years. Fully responsive templates were built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. During this project, I acted as viual designer, user experience designer, client consultant, CMS trainer and front-end developer. </p>

				<p>Youthspace is a service within Birmingham & Solihull Mental Health Trust that acts as an information and help point for young people with mental health issues. They required an online presence that was suitable for their young target audience but professional enough to represent the subject matter. Information architecture planning was paramount in a website where the user finding the right information quickly and easily was the number 1 priority. During this project, I acted as visual designer, information architect, and both front-end and back-end developer.</p>

				<p>Birmingham City University required a single sign-on portal that would work over all target browsers and devices including IE6 :(. This simple single page hides a complex mix of API connections, media queries and feature detection scripts that were required to allow students and staff alike to log into the university network no matter where they were or what device they were using.
